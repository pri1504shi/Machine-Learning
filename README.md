Project title: Cars price prediction.
Project description: This is machine learning project that focuses on breaking down certian properties of the cars being resold with particular selling price and present price. This also includes the year in which it is being resold. The dataset is taken from "Kaggle datasets", originally it was formed to predict the car price of each car depending on its properties, year being sold and the company of the car.
The project can be run by downloading the dataset(csv file) and running the code on any of the python interfaces. 
This code was created by me to predict the car price of each car and to analyse the inter-relation properties.
